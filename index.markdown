In April 2020, Evansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke created the Reopen Evansville Task Force and appointed Deputy Mayor Steve Schaefer to lead a comprehensive community effort to address challenges impacting our city and developing a path forward beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

As our community advances towards a complete reopening, this website will serve as a public archive of the hard work and dedication from our partners to help keep our community safe.
