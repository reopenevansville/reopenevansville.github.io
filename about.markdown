As the state of Indiana and entire nation has essentially been shut down since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impacts on the economy and our neighbors has been devastating. In response, Evansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke created the Reopen Evansville Task Force and appointed Deputy Mayor Steve Schaefer to lead a comprehensive community effort to address challenges impacting our city and developing a path forward. It is imperative for the city of Evansville to be prepared to reopen successfully per state and federal guidance.
Working under Governor Holcomb’s “Back on Track” plan for Indiana, the Task Force continues to work with community organizations and businesses to ensure a smooth transition.
The work of the Task Force will evolve as conditions improve and resources become available.
