Evansville residents not eligible to register for a COVID-19 vaccination can sign up on the following back up lists:

Vanderburgh County Health Department COVID-19 Back Up List
----------------------------------------------------------

All residents can sign up for Vanderburgh County Health Department's COVID-19 vaccine back up list.

You may be contacted in the event there are doses leftover at the end of the day.

You must be able to get to the clinic within 30 minutes of the phone call.

To ensure vaccine is given to our most vulnerable citizens, clients will be contacted by age and pre-existing conditions.

This will not be a first come, first serve.

Deaconess Call List
-------------------

At the end of each day, there are sometimes a few vaccine doses left over, which must be used immediately.

Following recently-updated state guidelines, Deaconess is collecting contact information for people who would like to be on a call list. 

Here are details:

-   **In both Indiana and Kentucky, you must be age 60 - 64.**
-   You must be willing to come to get your shot at very short notice, during evening hours, and be able to arrive within 45 minutes of receiving the call. 
-   You must answer your phone; if you do not answer, staff will move on to the next name on the list.
-   Entering your information on this form is not a substitute for making an actual appointment at a later date, when eligible.
