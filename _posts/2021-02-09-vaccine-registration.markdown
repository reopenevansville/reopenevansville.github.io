The vaccination of Hoosiers against COVID-19 has begun. Any Hoosier age 65 and older is now eligible to schedule a vaccination appointment, as are long-term care residents, first responders (firefighters, police officers and sheriff's deputies, emergency medical services, reservists and correctional officers) who are regularly called to the scene of an emergency to give medical aid, and licensed and unlicensed healthcare workers who have in-person contact with patients or infectious material in any healthcare setting.

Hoosiers age 65 and older can schedule a vaccination at the link in the red bar above or by calling 2-1-1 if they do not have access to a computer or need assistance registering. Eligible professionals should receive an invitation and registration link from their employer, professional association, or the State of Indiana (Indiana Department of Health, Professional Licensing Agency, Family & Social Services Administration, Department of Homeland Security, or another state agency). If you are a licensed healthcare provider, make sure your email is updated with the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency and continue to check your email and SPAM. If you are eligible and haven't received an invitation, please ask your employer.

Please be patient, as vaccine supply is limited. Additional groups will be eligible as soon as vaccine supplies permit.
