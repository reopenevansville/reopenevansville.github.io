Mayor Lloyd Winnecke is seeking to establish a Commission to address food security issues in our community. 

Upon request from the Winnecke Administration, City Council will consider approving an ordinance tonight to create the Commission on Food Security. 

The Commission will coordinate services, funding and programs related to food security. The 25-member body comprised of representatives from food-related organizations will also make recommendations to City government and other community stakeholders.

"Local nonprofits addressing food security have been working tirelessly towards the same goal," said Mayor Winnecke. "Establishing the Commission will help organizations mobilize and share their resources."

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed a gap in Evansville's food security. During Governor Eric Holcomb's stay-at-home order and school closures, local organizations reported 8,000 meals requested in a single day.

"The Reopen Evansville Task Force quickly identified food security as a key issue in our response to the pandemic," said Deputy Mayor Steve Schaefer. "The Task Force partnered with the Feed Evansville initiative and other agencies to fill the food security gap. This Commission is the next step in ensuring our residents have equitable access to food."
