The Reopen Evansville Task Force announced the extension of COVID-19 testing at C.K. Newsome Center.

Testing at the site --- which is administered by OptumServe --- will be extended through March, and is available for those that live and work in the Evansville region.

Operations will continue Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

"Through our partnership with the state, over 1,100 residents have been tested at the CK Newsome site in the past two weeks," said Steve Schaefer, Deputy Mayor & Chair of the Reopen Evansville Task Force. "Having the site open through August in a centrally located area of our city is tremendous news."

Registration is required. Those needing a test can register at [lhi.care/covidtesting](https://lhi.care/covidtesting) or call 888-634-1116.

Testing is free to all and no medical insurance is necessary. However, residents with existing insurance are asked to provide that information during the scheduling process.

The site was made possible through a collaboration between Mayor Lloyd Winnecke, the Vanderburgh County Health Department (VCHD) and the Indiana State Department of Health.
